Implementing YewPar: a Framework for Parallel Tree Search

ABSTRACT:
Combinatorial search is central to many applications yet hard to
parallelise.  We argue for improving the reuse of parallel searches,
and present the design and implementation of a new parallel search
framework. YewPar generalises search by abstracting search tree
generation, and by providing algorithmic skeletons that support three
search types, together with a set of search coordination
strategies. The evaluation shows that the cost of YewPar generality is
low (6.1%); global knowledge is inexpensively shared between workers;
irregular tasks are effectively distributed; and YewPar delivers good
runtimes, speedups and efficiency with up to 255 workers on 17
localities.
