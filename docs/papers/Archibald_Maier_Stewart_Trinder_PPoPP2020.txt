YewPar: Skeletons for Exact Combinatorial Search

ABSTRACT:
Combinatorial search is central to many applications, yet the huge
irregular search trees and the need to respect search heuristics make
it hard to parallelise. We aim to improve the reuse of intricate
parallel search implementations by providing the first general purpose
scalable parallel framework for exact combinatorial search, YewPar.

We make the following contributions.
(1) We present a novel formal model of parallel backtracking search,
    covering enumeration, decision, and optimisation search.
(2) We introduce Lazy Node Generators as a uniform API for search tree
    generation.
(3) We present the design and implementation of 12 widely applicable
    algorithmic skeletons for tree search on shared and distributed
    memory architectures.
(4) Uniquely in the field we demonstrate how a wide range of parallel
    search applications can easily be constructed by composing Lazy
    Node Generators and the search skeletons.
(5) We report a systematic performance analysis of all 12 YewPar
    skeletons on standard instances of 7 search applications,
    investigating skeleton overheads and scalability up to 255 workers
    on 17 distributed locations.
