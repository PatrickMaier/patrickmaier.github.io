Monitoring External Resources in Java MIDP

ABSTRACT:
We present a Java library for mobile phones which tracks and controls
at runtime the use of potentially costly resources, such as premium
rate text messages.  This improves on the existing framework (MIDP -
the Mobile Information Device Profile), where for example every text
message must be authorised explicitly by the user as it is sent.  Our
resource management library supports richer protocols, like advance
reservation and bulk messaging, while maintaining the security
guarantee that attempted resource abuse is trapped.
