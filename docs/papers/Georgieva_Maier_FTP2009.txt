Inductive Reasoning for Shape Invariants

ABSTRACT:
Automatic verification of imperative programs that destructively
manipulate heap data structures is challenging.  In this paper we
propose an approach for verifying that such programs do not corrupt
their data structures.  We specify heap data structures such as lists,
arrays of lists, and trees inductively as solutions of logic programs.
We use off-the-shelf first-order theorem provers to reason about these
specifications.
