Description Logics for Shape Analysis

ABSTRACT:
Verification of programs requires reasoning about sets of program
states.  In case of programs manipulating pointers, program states are
pointer graphs.  Verification of such programs involves reasoning
about unbounded sets of graphs.

Three-valued shape analysis (Sagiv et. al.) is an approach based on
explicit manipulation of 3-valued shape graphs, which abstract sets of
pointer graphs.  Other approaches use symbolic representations,
e.g. by describing (sets of) graphs as logical formulas.
Unfortunately, many resulting logics are either undecidable or cannot
express crucial properties like reachability and separation.

In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach.  We study
well-known description logics as a framework for symbolic shape
analysis.  We propose a predicate abstraction based shape analysis,
parameterized by description logics to represent the abstraction
predicates.  Depending on the particular logic chosen sharing,
reachability and separation in pointer data structures are
expressible.
