Intuitionistic LTL and a New Characterization of Safety and Liveness

ABSTRACT:
Classical linear-time temporal logic (LTL) is capable of specifying of
and reasoning about infinite behaviors only.  While this is
appropriate for specifying non-terminating reactive systems, there are
situations (e.g. assume-guarantee reasoning, run-time verification)
when it is desirable to be able to reason about finite and infinite
behaviors.  We propose an interpretation of the operators of LTL on
finite and infinite behaviors, which defines an intuitionistic
temporal logic (ILTL).  We compare the expressive power of LTL and
ILTL.  We demonstrate that ILTL is suitable for assume-guarantee
reasoning and for expressing properties that relate finite and
infinite behaviors. In particular, ILTL admits an elegant logical
characterization of safety and liveness properties.
