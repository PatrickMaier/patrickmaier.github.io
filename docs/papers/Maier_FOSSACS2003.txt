Compositional Circular Assume-Guarantee Rules Cannot Be Sound and Complete

ABSTRACT:
Circular assume-guarantee reasoning is used for the compositional
verification of concurrent systems. Its soundness has been studied in
depth, perhaps because circularity makes it anything but obvious.  In
this paper, we investigate completeness. We show that compositional
circular assume-guarantee rules cannot be both sound and complete.

KEYWORDS:
