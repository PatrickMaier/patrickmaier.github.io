High-Performance Computer Algebra: A Hecke Algebra Case Study

ABSTRACT:
We describe the first ever parallelisation of an algebraic computation
at modern HPC scale.  Our case study poses challenges typical of the
domain: it is a multi-phase application with dynamic task creation and
irregular parallelism over complex control and data structures.

Our starting point is a sequential algorithm for finding invariant
bilinear forms in the representation theory of Hecke algebras,
implemented in the GAP computational group theory system.  After
optimising the sequential code we develop a parallel algorithm that
exploits the new skeleton-based SGP2 framework to parallelise the
three most computationally-intensive phases.  To this end we develop a
new domain-specific skeleton, parBufferTryReduce.  We report good
parallel performance both on a commodity cluster and on a national
HPC, delivering speedups up to 548 over the optimised sequential
implementation on 1024 cores.
