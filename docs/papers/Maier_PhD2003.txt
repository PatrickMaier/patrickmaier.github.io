A Lattice-Theoretic Framework For Circular Assume-Guarantee Reasoning

ABSTRACT:
We develop an abstract lattice-theoretic framework within which we
study soundness and other properties of circular assume-guarantee
(A-G) rules constrained by side conditions.  We identify a particular
side condition, non-blockingness, which admits an intelligible
inductive proof of the soundness of circular A-G reasoning.  Besides,
conditional circular rules based on non-blockingness turn out to be
complete in various senses and stronger than a large class of sound
conditional A-G rules.  In this respect, our framework enlightens the
foundations of circular A-G reasoning.
Due to its abstractness, the framework can be instantiated to many
concrete settings.  We show several known circular A-G rules for
compositional verification to be instances of our generic rules.
Thus, we do the circularity-breaking inductive argument once to
establish soundness of our generic rules, which then implies soundness
of all the instances without resorting to technically complicated
circularity-breaking arguments for each single rule.  In this respect,
our framework unifies many approaches to circular A-G reasoning and
provides a starting point for the systematic development of new
circular A-G rules.
