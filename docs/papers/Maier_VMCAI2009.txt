Deciding Extensions of the Theories of Vectors and Bags

ABSTRACT:
Vectors and bags are basic collection data structures, which are used
frequently in programs and specifications.  Reasoning about these data
structures is supported by established algorithms for deciding ground
satisfiability in the theories of arrays (for vectors) and multisets
(for bags), respectively.  Yet, these decision procedures are only
able to reason about vectors and bags in isolation, not about their
combination.

This paper presents a decision procedure for the combination of the
theories of vectors and bags, even when extended with a function bagof
bridging between vectors and bags.  The function bagof converts
vectors into the bags of their elements, thus admitting vector/bag
comparisons.  Moreover, for certain syntactically restricted classes
of ground formulae decidability is retained if the theory of vectors
is extended further with a map function which applies uninterpreted
functions to all elements of a vector.
